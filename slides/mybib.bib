USAGE:

\bibliographystyle{mybstfile}
\bibliography{IEEEfull,mybibfile}

where the IEEE titles in the .bib database entries use the strings
defined here. e.g.,


   journal = IEEE_J_AC,


to yield "{IEEE} Transactions on Automatic Control"


WARNING: IEEE uses abbreviated journal titles in their bibliographies!
Because this file provides the full titles, you should NOT use this file
for work that is to be submitted to the IEEE.

For IEEE work, you should use the abbreviated titles provided in the
companion file, IEEEabrv.bib.


** NOTES **

 1. Journals have been grouped according to subject in order to make it
    easier to locate and extract the definitions for related journals - 
    as most works use references that are confined to a single topic.
    Magazines are listed in straight alphabetical order.

 2. String names are closely based on IEEE's own internal acronyms.

 3. Older, out-of-print IEEE titles are included (but not including titles
    dating prior to IEEE's formation from the IRE and AIEE in 1963).

 abstract = {In order to explain fairly simply how expectations are formed, we advance the hypothesis that they are essentially the same as the predictions of the relevant economic theory. In particular, the hypothesis asserts that the economy generally does not waste information, and that expectations depend specifically on the structure of the entire system. Methods of analysis, which are appropriate under special conditions, are described in the context of an isolated market with a fixed production lag. The interpretative value of the hypothesis is illustrated by introducing commodity speculation into the system.},

 abstract = {Alternative monetary policies are analyzed in an ad hoc macroeconomic model in which the public's expectations about prices are rational. The ad hoc model is one in which there is long-run neutrality, since it incorporates the aggregate supply schedule proposed by Lucas. Following Poole, the paper studies whether pegging the interest rate or pegging the money supply period by period minimizes an ad hoc quadratic loss function. It turns out that the probility distribution of output--dispersion as well as mean--is independent of the particular deterministic money supply rule in effect, and that under an interest rate rule the price level is indeterminate.},

    abstract = { It has often been argued that prices are sticky in the United States. However, the empirical papers that have claimed to support this view have not reflected any formal behavioral theory. This paper presents a theory that justifies price stickiness, namely, that firms, fearing to upset their customers, attribute a cost to price changes. The rational expectations equilibrium of an economy with many such firms is presented, estimated with postwar U.S. data, and tested against alternative hypotheses. The results largely support the model. Furthermore, the hypothesis that prices are not sticky is rejected by U.S. data. }

 abstract = {We investigate the flattening Phillips relation by making two departures from standard specifications. First, we measure slack using real activity variables that are bandpass filtered or year-over-year changes in activity (these are similar), instead of gaps. Second, we study the components of inflation instead of the standard aggregates. We find that some inflation components have strong and stable correlations with the cyclical component of real activity; these components tend to be relatively well-measured and domestically determined. Other components, typically prices that are poorly measured or internationally determined, have weak and/or unstable correlations with cyclical activity. We construct a new inflation index, Cyclically Sensitive Inflation, that weights the components by their joint cyclical covariation with real activity. The index has strong and stable correlations with cyclical activity and provides a real-time measure of cyclical movements in inflation.},

abstract = {Abstract Unemployment has a direct impact on public finances and yields serious sociopolitical implications. This study aims to directionally forecast the euro-area unemployment rate. To the best of our knowledge, no other studies forecast the euro-area unemployment rate as a whole. The data set includes the unemployment rate and 36 explanatory variables, as suggested by theory and the relevant literature, spanning the period from 1998:4 to 2019:9 in monthly frequency. These variables are fed to three machine learning methodologies: decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), and support vector machines (SVM), while an elastic-net logistic regression (logit) model is used from the area of econometrics. The results show that the optimal RF model outperforms the other models by reaching a full-dataset forecasting accuracy of 88.5\% and 85.4\% on the out-of-sample.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an advanced Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) methodology with a Genetic test in order to estimate unemployment forecasting in 23 high-tech and most-developed countries over the period 1998–2016. The main findings reveal that the methodology adopted ensures an excellent accuracy of unemployment forecasting for the selected countries, allowing the analysis of the contributions of each input to unemployment estimation as well. A significant role is exerted by GDP, labor productivity, population growth, and Artificial Intelligence innovation, while inflation assumes only a secondary role. A minor contribution is also observed in Foreign Direct Investments and government size. Therefore, economic growth based on innovation in Artificial Intelligence with explicit effects on productivity, under adequate population growth, seems to drive the unemployment rate.}
