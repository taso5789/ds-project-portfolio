    "text": "Ensemble learning refers to methods that combine multiple models to achieve higher predictive accuracy than any single model could provide. Among ensemble techniques, boosting is a powerful approach that builds a strong predictive model by sequentially adding many weak learners. A weak learner is a simple model—often a shallow decision tree—that performs only slightly better than random guessing. Although each weak learner has limited predictive capability, boosting improves overall performance by allowing each new learner to correct the errors of the previous ones.\nBoosting operates through an iterative refinement process. Each weak learner focuses on the mistakes made by the ensemble so far, gradually reducing both bias and variance. In early iterations, boosting decreases bias by adding learners that capture patterns missed by prior models. Later iterations refine the decision boundaries more carefully, with learning-rate regularization preventing excessive variance or overfitting.\n\n\n\n\nAdaBoost\n\nAdjusts the weights of individual samples based on whether they were misclassified.\nMisclassified samples receive higher weights so the next learner focuses on harder cases.\nWorks especially well for classification with simple decision stumps or shallow trees.\n\nGradient Boosting\n\nEach new learner fits the residuals (errors) of the previous model.\nUses gradient descent on the loss function, allowing flexibility for regression or classification.\nEach tree incrementally improves the prediction by reducing the remaining error.\n\nXGBoost\n\nAn optimized and regularized version of Gradient Boosting.\nIncorporates L1/L2 regularization to control model complexity.\nIncludes system-level optimizations such as parallelization, sparse-aware learning, and efficient tree-splitting algorithms.\nKnown for high speed and state-of-the-art performance on large datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoosting reduces bias by adding learners that progressively capture more structure in the data. Learning rate regulates how strongly each new learner influences the ensemble, helping prevent overfitting. As more learners are added, the ensemble can represent increasingly complex relationships, but careful tuning of hyperparameters is necessary to control variance.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoosting emphasizes improvement on the model’s weaknesses:\n\nAdaBoost increases the weights of misclassified samples.\nGradient Boosting models the residuals directly.\nXGBoost further optimizes residual fitting through second-order gradient information and regularization.\n\nThese mechanisms ensure that each iteration focuses on the most informative parts of the error landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Rate\nControls the contribution of each weak learner. Lower values improve generalization but require more estimators.\nNumber of Estimators\nDetermines how many weak learners are combined. More estimators increase model capacity but may lead to overfitting if not balanced.\nTree Depth\nControls the complexity of each weak learner. Shallow trees reduce variance, while deeper trees capture more structure but risk overfitting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic diagram showing the concept of ensemble learning.

This suggests that while K-Means does identify some meaningful separation at this cluster size, the overall cohesion within clusters and separation between clusters is limited. In other words, the structure captured by K-Means is relatively weak, and the method may be less effective at uncovering clear macroeconomic regimes in this dataset.\nIn contrast, hierarchical clustering with cosine distance yields consistently higher silhouette scores, reaching about 0.42 for k = 11. This indicates that hierarchical clustering provides more coherent and well-separated clusters, making it more reliable for identifying distinct macroeconomic states.\nDespite these differences, both methods converge on a similar conclusion: around 11–12 clusters represent a reasonable range for capturing the underlying structure of the data. This agreement suggests that the existence of multiple macroeconomic regimes is robust to the choice of clustering method.\nTaken together, both methods point to 11–12 clusters as a reasonable range, but hierarchical clustering is clearly the stronger approach in this application.\nIn the figures below, the left side shows the results of K-Means Clustering, while the right side shows the results of Hierarchical Clustering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSilhouette scores of K-Means clustering (Euclidean distance) across different numbers of clusters (k = 2–19).

    "text": "Notes: All images displayed on this page are free-use materials, unless otherwise indicated by a specific credit.\n\n\nBackgrounds\n\n\nThe relationship between inflation and unemployment has long constituted a central issue in the field of macroeconomics. These two indicators are not merely statistical constructs but rather fundamental determinants that directly affect the standard of living of households and the overall stability of society. Inflation reflects the purchasing power of money and exerts a profound influence on the decision-making processes of households and firms, while unemployment represents the state of labor market conditions and is closely associated with household income and the productive capacity of the economy. Historically, the evolution of these two variables has frequently posed conflicting challenges for policymakers. For example, expansionary policies may succeed in reducing unemployment in the short run, yet they simultaneously raise the likelihood of accelerating inflation. Conversely, policies aimed at containing inflation often depress aggregate demand, thereby heightening the risk of increased unemployment. Thus, reconciling the goals of price stability and full employment has consistently been a central concern in both economic theory and policy practice. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s explicit commitment to a “dual mandate” of price stability and maximum employment exemplifies this tension. Moreover, this dual mandate extends beyond considerations of economic efficiency alone, carrying critical implications for social cohesion and political stability. An uncontrolled surge in inflation can undermine household welfare and destabilize everyday life, while persistently elevated unemployment can exacerbate inequality, fuel political unrest, and highlight the need for a comprehensive theoretical and empirical understanding of their dynamics for effective policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a classical contribution to this theme, Phillips (1958) demonstrated the existence of a stable negative correlation between wage growth and the unemployment rate, thereby presenting the important insight that the balance of supply and demand in the labor market is directly linked to wage fluctuations. His study was based on long-term data from the United Kingdom, but the result came to be regarded as a general phenomenon observable in many countries. Subsequently, Samuelson and Solow (1960), through an empirical study using U.S. data, generalized Phillips’s finding into a trade-off relationship between inflation and unemployment, emphasizing the possibility of applying this relationship to economic policy and suggesting that policymakers could “choose” a desirable combination of the two. This interpretation had a major impact on macroeconomic policy debates at the time, but the stability of the relationship was questioned early on, and a series of theoretical objections soon emerged. Muth (1961), with the rational expectations hypothesis, challenged the traditional adaptive expectations framework by assuming that agents form expectations consistent with the underlying economic model. Furthermore, Sargent and Wallace (1975) advanced the policy ineffectiveness proposition, arguing that anticipated monetary policy has no lasting impact on real economic activity, and Lucas (1976) added the critique that statistically observed macroeconomic relationships may shift depending on the prevailing policy rule. These arguments highlighted the limitations of using the Phillips curve directly for policy purposes and led to the understanding that there is no sustained long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment, with the unemployment rate converging to its natural rate. At the same time, since the neoclassical framework assuming perfectly flexible prices could not sufficiently explain short-run business cycle fluctuations, the need for more realistic models increased. Against this background, New Keynesian models such as the price adjustment cost model by Rotemberg (1982) and the stochastic price-setting model by Calvo (1983) emerged, demonstrating that by explicitly incorporating nominal rigidities, a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment could indeed exist. These models were subsequently systematized by Woodford (2003), forming the standard theoretical foundation of modern monetary policy analysis and becoming widely referenced in the practice of central banking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: WallStreetMojo\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the empirical side, the strength and stability of the relationship between inflation and unemployment have consistently been a subject of debate. In particular, recent studies indicate that the Phillips curve does not function as a fixed empirical regularity but rather changes its shape depending on the historical period and economic environment. Ball and Mazumder (2011), using U.S. data, reported a flattening of the Phillips curve and demonstrated that the impact of unemployment fluctuations on inflation has weakened substantially compared to the past. This finding is consistent with the anchoring of inflation expectations and the increased credibility of monetary policy, and it has been recognized as a factor contributing to the stability of inflation. Blanchard (2016) focused on U.S. inflation dynamics and emphasized that, unlike in earlier periods, changes in unemployment no longer move inflation rates as strongly, making it more difficult for policymakers to rely on the Phillips curve. Furthermore, Stock and Watson (2019) showed that the predictability of U.S. inflation has declined markedly in recent years and concluded that traditional Phillips curve–based forecasting models fail to deliver sufficient accuracy. Hazell et al. (2022), using state-level panel data, provided empirical evidence that the relationship between inflation and unemployment changes nonlinearly depending on whether the economy is subject to demand or supply shocks. Their research is important in that it highlights how relationships that appear blurred in aggregate macroeconomic data can become more clearly identifiable at the regional level. Taken together, this body of work suggests that the Phillips curve does not simply operate as a stable relationship in which “lower unemployment leads to higher inflation,” but instead varies significantly depending on economic conditions, the nature of shocks, and policy regimes. Therefore, analyzing the relationship between inflation and unemployment requires a flexible approach that goes beyond reliance on static empirical regularities and takes into account institutional contexts and the characteristics of shocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, with the advancement of machine learning, there has been a rapid increase in attempts to apply data-driven methods to the forecasting of key macroeconomic variables such as inflation and unemployment. These methods have attracted attention because they offer the potential to capture nonlinearities and complex interdependencies that traditional linear regression and time-series models fail to detect. Medeiros et al. (2021), using U.S. inflation data, employed Random Forests and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) in their analysis and reported predictive accuracy superior to that of conventional AutoRegressive (AR) and factor models, thereby demonstrating that machine learning can hold an advantage over traditional approaches. This study provided results directly relevant to improving inflation forecasts used in practice by central banks and other policymakers, underscoring its empirical significance. Furthermore, Gogas et al. (2021) examined unemployment in the euro area as a whole and compared machine learning techniques with traditional time-series models, showing that machine learning has an advantage in short-term forecasting. They found that while Random Forests and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) achieve higher prediction accuracy, challenges remain regarding model interpretability and policy applicability, highlighting the difficulty of applying machine learning directly to policy operations. This issue points to a fundamental challenge in macroeconomic research—namely, how to balance predictive accuracy with theoretical consistency and policy relevance. In addition, Magazzino et al. (2025) analyzed unemployment across 23 advanced economies using artificial neural networks and demonstrated that factors such as GDP, labor productivity, demographic dynamics, and even AI-driven technological innovation are major determinants of unemployment fluctuations. Their results suggest that unemployment dynamics depend not only on cyclical factors but also heavily on structural and technological elements. Taken together, these studies underscore that while machine learning has proven effective for forecasting macroeconomic variables, they also highlight the need to overcome challenges related to model transparency and practical policy applicability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, important challenges remain in this line of research. First, much of the existing literature has focused on either inflation or unemployment in isolation, and there are relatively few attempts to analyze both variables in an integrated manner and systematically capture their interactions. In fact, although inflation and unemployment should be considered simultaneously from both theoretical and policy perspectives, many empirical studies have tended to concentrate on only one side. Second, while many studies emphasize the evaluation of predictive accuracy, frameworks that combine regime classification with regression-based forecasting have not been sufficiently developed. For example, only a limited number of studies identify regimes such as high- and low-inflation periods or recessions and expansions, and then evaluate predictive performance within each of these states. Third, much of the data used are drawn from commercial databases or restricted sources, which imposes constraints on transparency and reproducibility, although the use of open data could create an environment in which a broader range of researchers and policymakers can more easily replicate and extend results. Few studies, however, have explicitly incorporated this consideration. Fourth, the linear regression models that continue to play a central role in policy analysis, such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Vector Auto Regressive (VAR), are rarely compared directly with machine learning methods within a unified framework. This lack of comparison has limited the perspective needed for policymakers to understand how traditional and modern methods might be used in a complementary fashion, and the absence of such evaluations represents a major obstacle to assessing the practical applicability of machine learning in real-world policy contexts. Therefore, future research must adopt a more comprehensive approach that addresses not only predictive accuracy but also interpretability and policy relevance at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the foregoing discussion, the objectives of this study can be organized into four main points. First, it aims to conduct an integrated analysis of inflation and unemployment by comparing traditional regression models (OLS, VAR, Elastic Net) with machine learning techniques (Naïve Bayes, decision trees, SVM, and neural networks) within a unified framework, thereby evaluating both predictive accuracy and interpretability. Second, it seeks to identify macroeconomic regimes through clustering and principal component analysis, and to apply classification and regression approaches in an integrated manner so as to examine simultaneously “where the economy currently stands” and “how it is likely to evolve.” Third, it will systematically analyze the dynamic causal relationship and regime dependence between inflation and unemployment using Granger causality tests and local projection methods. Fourth, by utilizing open and reproducible data sources such as the FRED API, the BLS API, and the World Bank API, the study aims to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the analysis and to provide a research platform that can be replicated and extended by a broad range of readers, including academic researchers and policymakers. Through these four pillars, this study aspires to bridge traditional research on the Phillips curve with contemporary machine learning approaches, thereby offering a new understanding of the relationship between inflation and unemployment. In addition, the study emphasizes not only the re-examination of existing findings but also the direct comparison between machine learning and regression analysis, with the explicit goal of deriving practical implications for policy applications. In light of this, the study sets forth 10 research questions designed to reconsider the relationship between inflation and unemployment from multiple perspectives, beginning with the existence of a short-run trade-off and expanding to assess regime dependence and the role of macroeconomic factors. Furthermore, by comparing the predictive performance and interpretability of machine learning and traditional models, they also delve into the causal direction of the relationship and the dynamic effects of shocks. Accordingly, this study seeks to provide a systematic framework that comprehensively addresses both theoretical and empirical challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Questions\n\n\nIs a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment statistically observable?\nTo what extent does the Phillips curve relationship vary across business-cycle phases (recessions and expansions) and policy regimes (e.g., the zero lower bound period or the COVID-19 era)?\nHow do macroeconomic factors extracted through principal component analysis (PCA) affect the dynamics of inflation and unemployment?\nDoes regime identification based on data-driven clustering align with historical episodes such as stagflation or the post–global financial crisis recovery?\nTo what extent can simple classification models such as Naïve Bayes and decision trees accurately identify periods of high inflation or high unemployment?\nDoes the support vector machine (SVM) improve regime-classification accuracy compared with simpler classifiers such as Naïve Bayes and decision trees?\nHow do traditional regression models (OLS, VAR, Elastic Net) and machine learning models (SVM, neural networks) differ in their performance when forecasting inflation and unemployment one, three, and six months ahead?\nCan performance differences across forecasting models be judged statistically significant using tests such as the Diebold–Mariano test?\nAccording to Granger causality tests, what is the causal direction between inflation and unemployment (inflation → unemployment or unemployment → inflation)?\nThrough local projection analysis, how do demand shocks and supply shocks dynamically affect inflation and unemployment?"

This reflects a short-run Phillips curve relationship, namely higher inflationary pressures → lower unemployment.\nBusiness cycle factors (second and third principal components): These are closely linked to real economic activity (production, retail sales, and labor market indicators) and represent business cycle conditions by primarily driving unemployment fluctuations. Their effects on inflation generally emerge with a lag through the demand channel, with MoM inflation responding earlier than YoY inflation, as it is more sensitive to short-term fluctuations.\n\nIn summary, PCA facilitates the identification of distinct macroeconomic drivers, isolating an inflation factor and business cycle factors, and thereby providing a structured account of how persistent price pressures and cyclical labor market conditions jointly shape the evolution of inflation and unemployment."

Source: Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt each step, a decision tree must determine “which question will most efficiently split the data.” To make this judgment, it uses metrics like Gini Impurity or Entropy. These metrics measure the “impurity” or “disorder” of the data within a node.\nGini Impurity: This metric indicates how mixed the classes are within a node. A value close to 0 means the node is “pure” (contains data from mostly one class), while a higher value means it is “impure” (contains a mix of different classes). It is known for being relatively fast to compute. \\[\nGini(S) = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} (p_i)^2\n\\] where \\(p_i\\) is the proportion of data belonging to class \\(i\\).\nEntropy: Originating from information theory, this is another metric for measuring data impurity. Like Gini Impurity, a value of 0 indicates perfect purity, while a higher value indicates more impurity. \\[\nH(S) = - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i \\log_2(p_i)\n\\]\nInformation Gain is the metric that shows “how much the impurity decreased” as a result of splitting the data by a certain question (feature). At each step, the decision tree selects the question that maximizes this Information Gain.\nInformation Gain is calculated with the following formula:\n\nInformation Gain = Impurity before split – (Weighted average of impurity of each node after split)\n\nIn other words, a split that creates purer groups (groups with lower impurity) is judged to be a “good split.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s consider a small dataset used to predict “whether to play tennis or not” based on weather data.\n\nEntire Dataset (10 instances):\n\nPlay Tennis: 5\nDon’t Play Tennis: 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we calculate the Gini Impurity of the entire dataset (the root node).\n\n\\[Gini_{root} = 1 - ((\\frac{5}{10})^2 + (\\frac{5}{10})^2) = 1 - (0.25 + 0.25) = \\mathbf{0.5}\\]\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s assume we split the data based on whether the “Wind is Weak or Strong.”\n\nWeak Wind Group (6 instances):\n\nPlay Tennis: 5\nDon’t Play Tennis: 1\n\\(Gini_{weak} = 1 - ((\\frac{5}{6})^2 + (\\frac{1}{6})^2) \\approx 1 - (0.694 + 0.028) = \\mathbf{0.278}\\)\n\nStrong Wind Group (4 instances):\n\nPlay Tennis: 0\nDon’t Play Tennis: 4\n\\(Gini_{strong} = 1 - ((\\frac{0}{4})^2 + (\\frac{4}{4})^2) = 1 - (0 + 1) = \\mathbf{0}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the weighted average Gini Impurity after the split.\n\n\\[Gini_{after\\_split} = (\\frac{6}{10}) \\times 0.278 + (\\frac{4}{10}) \\times 0 = 0.1668 + 0 = 0.1668\\]\n\nFinally, calculate the Information Gain.\n\n\\[\\text{Information Gain} = Gini_{root} - Gini_{after\\_split} = 0.5 - 0.1668 = \\mathbf{0.3332}\\]\n\nThis value of 0.3332 represents the “goodness” of the split using the “Wind” feature. The decision tree performs similar calculations for other features (like Outlook, Humidity, etc.) and chooses the split rule that results in the highest Information Gain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheoretically, it is possible to create an infinite number of decision trees. There are two main reasons for this:\n\nPerfectly Memorizing Data (Overfitting): If no limits are placed on the tree’s depth or splitting, the algorithm will continue splitting until every single sample in the training data is isolated in its own leaf node. This results in a model that is 100% accurate on the training data but is useless for predicting new, unseen data. This creates an overly complex tree known as an overfit model.\nFeatures with Continuous Values: When features contain continuous values like “temperature” or “humidity,” there are infinitely many potential split points (e.g., split at Temp &gt; 25.0°C, Temp &gt; 25.01°C, etc.). This theoretically allows for the creation of infinitely many different tree structures.\n\nIn practice, to prevent such overfitting, techniques called “Pruning” are used to properly control the tree’s complexity. This includes limiting the maximum depth of the tree or setting a minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node."

It is known for being relatively fast to compute. \\[\nGini(S) = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} (p_i)^2\n\\] where \\(p_i\\) is the proportion of data belonging to class \\(i\\).\nEntropy: Originating from information theory, this is another metric for measuring data impurity. Like Gini Impurity, a value of 0 indicates perfect purity, while a higher value indicates more impurity. \\[\nH(S) = - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i \\log_2(p_i)\n\\]\nInformation Gain is the metric that shows “how much the impurity decreased” as a result of splitting the data by a certain question (feature). At each step, the decision tree selects the question that maximizes this Information Gain.\nInformation Gain is calculated with the following formula:\n\nInformation Gain = Impurity before split – (Weighted average of impurity of each node after split)\n\nIn other words, a split that creates purer groups (groups with lower impurity) is judged to be a “good split.”"

    "text": "Theoretically, it is possible to create an infinite number of decision trees. There are two main reasons for this:\n\nPerfectly Memorizing Data (Overfitting): If no limits are placed on the tree’s depth or splitting, the algorithm will continue splitting until every single sample in the training data is isolated in its own leaf node. This results in a model that is 100% accurate on the training data but is useless for predicting new, unseen data. This creates an overly complex tree known as an overfit model.\nFeatures with Continuous Values: When features contain continuous values like “temperature” or “humidity,” there are infinitely many potential split points (e.g., split at Temp &gt; 25.0°C, Temp &gt; 25.01°C, etc.). This theoretically allows for the creation of infinitely many different tree structures.\n\nIn practice, to prevent such overfitting, techniques called “Pruning” are used to properly control the tree’s complexity. This includes limiting the maximum depth of the tree or setting a minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node."
